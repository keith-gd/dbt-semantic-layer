Bank of America Institute methodology: The gold standard
The October 2025 Consumer Checkpoint exemplifies rigorous consumer spending analysis. Key methodological elements your debit card program should emulate:

Measurement precision:

Per household spending growth - Isolates households with 5+ transactions monthly to filter out spurious accounts

Seasonally adjusted metrics - 3-month moving averages smooth volatility, annualized rates enable YoY comparisons

Fixed cohort tracking - Baseline from January 2019 enables consistent comparisons even as customer base evolves

Inflation adjustment - Balances tracked in real terms to separate nominal growth from purchasing power

Segmentation approaches:

Income terciles - Lower (bottom 33%), middle (34-66%), higher (top 33%), plus separate top 5% tracking for wealth effects

Generational cohorts - Gen Z, Younger Millennials, Older Millennials, Gen X, Baby Boomers, Traditionalists

Geographic breakdown - Census regions, MSA-level analysis, urban vs. rural patterns

Spending categories - Retail ex-restaurants/gas, discretionary services, non-discretionary services, durables with premium vs. value tiers

Key metrics tracked:

Total credit & debit card spending per household (MoM% and YoY%, seasonally adjusted)

Transaction counts and average transaction values by category

Median checking and savings balances by cohort

After-tax wage and salary growth via direct deposit flows

Credit utilization rates by generation

Share of wallet analysis (discretionary vs. essential spending)

Critical insight: The Institute explicitly documents methodology limitations—selection bias acknowledged, processing vs. transaction date differences noted, portfolio changes addressed. This transparency builds trust in metric definitions.

Metric patterns for behavior analysis
Cohort retention patterns:

Trailing window actives - Users with 1+ transaction in last 7/30/90 days

Continuous activity periods - Consecutive months with activity (detects power users)

Dormancy detection - Days since last transaction, flagged at 30/60/90 day thresholds

Reactivation tracking - Previously dormant accounts that resumed activity

Normalized metrics (per-user basis):

Spend per Active User - Total spend / Monthly active users (removes growth effects)

Transactions per Active Day - Total transactions / DAU (measures engagement intensity)

Revenue per Funded Account - Total revenue / Accounts with >$10 balance (focuses on engaged segment)

Time-based comparisons:

Same-cohort analysis - Compare January 2024 registrants' Month 1 behavior vs. January 2025 registrants' Month 1

Period-over-period growth - MoM%, QoQ%, YoY% with seasonal adjustments

Cohort maturation - How metrics evolve as cohorts age (Month 1 vs Month 6 vs Month 12 behavior)

Segment-based analysis:

High-value user criteria - Top 20% by spend, top 10% by transaction count, top 5% by balance

Persona tagging - Paycheck-to-paycheck (low balance, high transaction frequency), Savers (high balance, low spend), Credit-builders (utilizes credit features)

Merchant category affinity - % of spend in grocery, gas, dining, online shopping by segment
